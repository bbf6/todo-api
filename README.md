# todo-api

This is an api created in order to give support to [this Quasar tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opmng7llVJ0&list=PLAiDzIdBfy8iu_MZrq3IPuSFcRgCQ0iL0) since I don't like firebase.

You can see the swagger api documentation on [https://todo.devartiral.com/api-docs](https://todo.devartiral.com/api-docs) and the front on [https://todo.devartiral.com](https://todo.devartiral.com)

The front repository is in [here](https://github.com/bbf6/awsome-todo)
